# Assuming your data is stored in a Pandas DataFrame called 'data' and has missing values represented as NaNs

# Step 1: Impute missing values using a differentially private mean imputation
for column in data.columns:
    col_values = to_array(data[column].dropna().values)  # Convert column values to array
    mean_val = mean(col_values, epsilon=1.0)  # Apply differentially private mean imputation
    data[column] = data[column].fillna(mean_val)  # Fill NaNs with differentially private mean

# Step 2: Add Laplace noise to ensure differential privacy
# Note: Epsilon and sensitivity should be appropriately chosen based on the context and privacy requirements
epsilon = 1.0  # Privacy budget
sensitivity = 1.0  # Sensitivity of the mean operation

# Add Laplace noise to the imputed data
for column in data.columns:
    data[column] += np.random.laplace(scale=sensitivity / epsilon, size=len(data))

# Now 'data' contains differentially privately imputed values with added noise


#Mean imputation is used to fill missing values for each column in a differentially private manner. 
# The diffprivlib library provides a mean function that computes the mean in a differentially private way.

# Laplace noise is added to the imputed values to ensure differential privacy. 
# The scale of the Laplace noise is determined based on the sensitivity of the mean operation and the chosen privacy parameter (epsilon).

# It's crucial to note that the choice of epsilon (privacy parameter) is fundamental to the level of privacy protection. 
# Lower epsilon values offer higher privacy but might compromise utility. Additionally, determining the sensitivity of operations (such as mean) is crucial for accurate noise addition.

# This approach provides a differentially private imputation strategy by adding noise to the imputed values,
#  ensuring that individual data points' privacy is protected within a certain privacy budget (controlled by epsilon). 
# This method maintains the privacy guarantees of differential privacy by carefully considering the privacy parameters used in the operations.%%
