# ag_sklearn: Extending Diffprivlib for Enhanced Scikit-Learn Functionality

Welcome to `ag_sklearn`, an open-source repository that extends the capabilities of the widely recognized `diffprivlib`, a general-purpose library focused on differential privacy. This repository is an initiative by the open-source community at CodePeak 2023, aiming to broaden the scope of `diffprivlib` by integrating more functionalities from Scikit-Learn (sklearn). 

The core of `ag_sklearn` is based on `diffprivlib v0.6`. We credit the original authors and contributors of `diffprivlib` for their exceptional work, and our project builds upon this foundation to explore new frontiers in privacy-preserving machine learning.

### Background: Diffprivlib v0.6
- **Core Functionality**: `diffprivlib` is designed for experimenting with, investigating, and developing differential privacy applications. It supports a range of machine learning tasks like classification, clustering, and more.
- **Python Compatibility**: Compatible with Python versions 3.8 to 3.11.

### ag_sklearn: What's New?
`ag_sklearn` extends the functionality of `diffprivlib` by incorporating additional Scikit-Learn features, enhancing the library's capabilities in privacy-preserving machine learning. We strive to maintain compatibility with the existing `diffprivlib` interface while adding new functionalities and improvements.

### Contributing to ag_sklearn
As an open-source project, `ag_sklearn` thrives on community contributions. We welcome contributions from developers, researchers, and enthusiasts in the field. Whether it's adding new features, improving documentation, or fixing bugs, your contributions are valuable to us.

To get started head over the the open issues and try to implement a solution to them under a new branch. Once complete raise a PR.
